## Lecture Notes
Course orientation and expectations

### About Me
- [nigelharsch.com](https://nigelharsch.com)
- Theatrical Sound Designer and Composer
	- Sometimes films
	- Sometimes games
- Web Developer
- Sound isn't new to me
- Game design is

### Course Intro
- Main Goals
	- Basics of Sound
		- What it is
		- How to talk about it
	- Working with Sound
		- Editing
		- Sourcing
		- Recording
			- Voice Over
			- Foley
	- Sound's role in games
	- Technical implementation
		- Asset Sheets
		- Unity Integration
		- Middleware
	- Git sidequest

#### Sound as Material
- First Goal in class is to teach sound as a material and the tools we use to manipulate it
	- Will have more lectures and domonstrations
- will focus on sound for games specifically later
	- Will be more hands on and guided by your projects
	
#### Specific Tools
- Adobe Audition 
	- To teach destructive editing
- Pro Tools
	- For multitracking, to teach signal flow
- Unity
	- You've probably heard of it
	- Sound basics in Unity
- FMOD
	- adanved sound integration with Unity
- Git sidequest
	- Use git for submitting exercises and projects

#### What are your goals / objectives?

...Let's get started

### What is sound
- [quick sound intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfzCLClVO8g)
- changes in sound pressure level, detected by the ear
- How we hear	
	- two ears = stereo
	- volume differences and slight delays in sounds tell us position
	- our perception of loudness isn't linear
	- huge range of human hearing
	- we don't hear all frequencies equally
- sounds are waveforms
- what is a waveform, what does it represent?
	- temproal, time based
	- aplitude changes over time
- waves: frequency and amplitude
	- sine, square, saw
	- relative to zero point
		- negative and positive phase values
		- 0 is quiet
		- Amplitude is distance from 0 point
- complex waves: many frequencies combined
	- intro to EQ
		- one hertz = one oscilation per second
		- we here from 20hz -> 20khz
	- simple waves have one frequency
		- sine wave
		- square wave
	- real sounds are complex
		- piano note will have fundemental frequency	
		- will also have high and low "harmonics"
- attack and decay
	- attack decay (and sustain release)
	- waveform: gunshot verses cars passing
	- waveform: drumbeat vs human speech
- acoustic sound vs electronic vs digital
	- acoustic is changes in atmospheric pressure
	- analog electric audio is voltage in wire
		- converted from acoustic using microphones and speakers
	- digital audio is a stream of numbers representing voltage measured n times a second
	- acoustic and analog are continuous, digital is discrete (pixelated)
- what digital sound gets us
	- consistent playblack
	- smaller storage
	- digital tools
	- synthesis
	- portability
	- accessability
	- DAWs
	
## Assigments
### Exercise 1: 
- Game Clip Audio Assessment
	- objective analysis
- what do you think this sound is quiz
	- show pics of sounds, multiple choice answers for each
