# Lecture Notes
Course orientation and expectations

## Course Intro
- TODO

## Sound as Material
- Main Goals
	- Basics of Sound
	- Working with Sound
	- Sound's role in games
	- Technical implementation
	- Git sidequest

- First Goal in class is to teach sound as a material and the tools we use to manipulate it
- will focus on sound for games specifically later

## What is sound
- changes in sound pressure level, detected by the ear
- How we hear	
	- two ears = stereo
	- volume differences and slight delays in sounds tell us position
	- our perception of loudness isn't linear
	- huge range of human hearing
	- we don't hear all frequencies equally
- sounds are waveforms
- what is a waveform, what does it represent?
	- temproal, time based
	- aplitude changes over time
- waves: frequency and amplitude
	- sine, square, saw
	- relative to zero point
		- negative and positive phase values
		- 0 is quiet
		- Amplitude is distance from 0 point
- complex waves: many frequencies combined
	- intro to EQ
- attack and decay
	- attack decay (and sustain release)
	- waveform: gunshot verses cars passing
	- waveform: drumbeat vs human speech
- acoustic sound vs electronic vs digital
	- acoustic is changes in atmospheric pressure
	- analog electric audio is voltage in wire
		- converted from acoustic using microphones and speakers
	- digital audio is a stream of numbers representing voltage measured n times a second
	- acoustic and analog are continuous, digital is discrete (pixelated)
- what digital sound gets us
	- consistent playblack
	- smaller storage
	- digital tools
	- synthesis
	- portability
	- accessability
	- DAWs
	
# Assigments
## Exercise 1: 
- Game Clip Audio Assessment
	- objective analysis
- what do you think this sound is quiz
	- show pics of sounds, multiple choice answers for each
