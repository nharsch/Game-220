# Week 2 - 1/21/22
- Exercise 1 Due

## Lecture Notes
Game Audio Technology (sampling; MIDI; audio compression, middleware)

### Reading
- [[The Essential Guide to Game Audio#Intro]]
- [[The Essential Guide to Game Audio#Level 1 - Animation Art Audio]]
- [[The Essential Guide to Game Audio#Level 2 - Brief History of Games]]
- [[The Essential Guide to Game Audio#Level 3 - Audio for Interactive Evironments]]

### Introduction the DAWs
- Destructive editing vs non destructive
	- Audition waveform view vs multitrack
	- Concept of splicing tape
	- Multiple lanes, mixing
	- "printing" effects vs effects racks

### Editing Concepts
#### Editing
- tape splice analogy
- zero crossing

#### Volume, Fades
- volume aka gain aka level
- normalization
- Decibel
	- is a relative measure of volume
	- db is measured against some standard
	- db SPL - relative to threshold of human hearing
	- 6db increase is about twice as loud
	- 10 decibels = a bel = one order of magnitude greater
		-   Near total silence - 0 dB
		-   A whisper - 15 dB
		-   Normal conversation - 60 dB
		-   A lawnmower - 90 dB
		-   A car horn - 110 dB
		-   A rock concert or a jet engine - 120 dB
		-   A gunshot or firecracker - 140 dB
	- Quick Video to explain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZLQoP6CM0k
- fades: changing volume over time
- eliminating zero crossing "clicks"
- Pan : balance of volume between left and right

#### EQ 
- human hearing 20hz-20khz
- sub bass 
	- felt more than heard
	- often lost in reproduction
	  - need subs
- bass
	- complex waves sound muddy
	- travel farther
    - associated with larger objects
- lower midrange
	- "warmth"
	- chesty
- higher midrange
	- nasal
	- we're especially sensitive
- high
	- texture
	- enunciatrion and articulation
	- crispy
	- old people lose it 

### Hands on with destructive audio editing - Audition
- waveform view
- transport controls
- how to trim sound
- how to amplify
- fades
- using EQ

### Git refresher
- What git is
- How branching works
- git clients

## Assignments
### Exercise 2: Stand Alone Game SFX
- git repo
- Find or create sound effects for given asset sheet CSV
- All clips should be normalized
- clean tops and tails
- deliver CSV with filenames and files
