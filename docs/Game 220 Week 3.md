## Explain Assignment

## Advanced Sound Editing Concepts
Speed and Pitch
- related by default
	- dropping both results in lower EQ range
- can be separated with digital algorithms
	- time stretch: slowed without changing pitch
	- pitch effect: raise pitch without speed

Reverb / Delay aka "time based"
- delay is repition of sound
	- usually at decresing volume
	- sometimes decreasing EQ
	- simple delay is one regular repeat over fixed time
	- "spacey" 
- reverb
	- many delays all so close together they "blur"
	- "breathy"
	- "wet"
	- "cold"

Compression / Gate
- Gate more important

Noise Reduction
- complex algorithm

Distortion
- complex harmonic interaction

Reverse

## Creative sound techniques
- slow it down
- speed it up
- creative EQ
- reverse it
- put attack of one sound to decay of another
- put lots of reverb on it
- distort it
